me: what does the <article> tag do in html

ChatGPT: The <article> tag in HTML is used to represent a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed or reused independently. It's typically used for content that forms a distinct, standalone unit within a web page. Here are some key points about the <article> tag:

	1. Semantic Meaning: The <article> tag adds semantic meaning to your HTML. It indicates that the enclosed content can be understood independently of the rest of the page.

	2. Use Cases: Common examples of content that might be wrapped in an <article> tag include blog posts, news articles, forum posts, or user comments.

	3. Accessibility: By using <article>, you help improve accessibility and SEO, as it provides context for search engines and assistive technologies about the nature of the content.

	4. Structure: Within an <article>, you might include headings, paragraphs, images, and other elements that contribute to the content of that particular article.


Hereâ€™s a basic example of how you might use the <article> tag:


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Article Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <article>
        <h1>The Importance of Web Accessibility</h1>
        <p>Web accessibility ensures that websites and web applications are usable by people of all abilities and disabilities.</p>
        <p>It involves designing and developing websites that work for everyone, including people with disabilities who may use assistive technologies to interact with the web.</p>
    </article>
</body>
</html>


In this example, the <article> tag encapsulates a piece of content about web accessibility, making it clear that this content is a distinct unit.
